# Week 5

During this week I continued to implement the markov model to password guessing. I managed to get ngrams out of text using markov model even though the password guessing feature is not yet implemented fully. After I get the guessing feature implemented, I'm going to implement trie structure to words which hopefully will make the program faster.
