# Week 3

During this week I refactored the code to follow object oriented paradigm. In addition I changed the program input from terminal prompt question to file. Now the program reads a .txt file that can also containt multiple passwords separeted by new line. This turned out to be quite time consuming. 

I also implemented python coverage tool for test coverage measuring. The next thing is finally to start the implementation of the algorithms.
