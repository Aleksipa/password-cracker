# Week 6

During this week I finished the implementation of the markov model to password guessing. In addition I added some test and configuration option for user to select the lenght of the ngram and number of guesses the program makes when executed. It seems that currently I'm somewhat behind the schedule, but aim going to catch up during the weekend. Next thing is t to implement trie structure to ngram storage and then replace dict's and tuple's with my own implementation.
