# Project definition

The aim of this project is to implement a program that enables a user to test the strength of the given password. The program repeatedly generates guesses that aim to match the password the user has given. After completion the program compares solving methods by showing execution times and number of guesses of the different methods.

## Algorithms and data structrures

The program generates guesses using two different approaches. On of which is based on brute force algorithm and the other on Markov model-based method implemented with trie data structure.

## Input and output

The input is a user given password and the output is the execution time it takes for a brute force password guesser and Markov model-based password guesser to guess the given password.
