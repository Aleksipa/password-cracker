# Week 1

During this week I attended the introduction lecture and read trough the course materials. I found security related topics interesting and therefore I started to look for an interesting topic in that field. I found interesting discussion about password security and password cracking. Threrefore I decided to go for a password cracking algorithm comparison.

I read though the wikipedia page about password cracking and found couple of interesting articles about the subject such as Tobias Lundbergs paper on Comparison of Automated Password Guessing Strategies.

I was a little unsure about what kind of algorithms I should be implementing and comparing but I'm hoping to get more clear picture after I spent more time with the literature. I also created a GitHub repository for the project.
