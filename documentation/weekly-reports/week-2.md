# Week 2

During this week I spent some time trying acquire a deeper level of understanding about what I'm trying to build and I think I managed to accomplish that goal fairly well. In addition, I started to implement the program. At the moment I have only implemented a fairly simple brute force algorithm, which uses itertools library. The next thing is replace the itertools with my own implementation and write more tests.

I haven't done any programming for a while and it took some time to get going. In addition, I noticed that I forgot to update github alltogether. I decided to use Python instead of Java because I'm hoping to implement some neural network algorithm after I have finished the brute force and markov models based approaches.
